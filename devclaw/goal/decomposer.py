"""The goal decomposer — the new SECOND HALF of the ``investigating`` phase.

Today's lifecycle::

    Goal created
      ↓ lifecycle: investigating
    dispatch review_repository → repo_analysis (prose)
      ↓
    research.discovery_brief() → prose brief (## Current state / Gap / Good)
      ↓ lifecycle: executing
    per-tick planner reads brief + backlog → emits ONE action

What this module adds (Pillar 1)::

    Goal created
      ↓ lifecycle: investigating
    review_repository → repo_analysis                       [existing]
      ↓
    research.discovery_brief() → prose brief                 [existing]
      ↓
    decompose() → checklist.yaml                            [NEW: this module]
      atomic items with evidence_target + addresses_files +
      depends_on; per-tool, not per-clause; SPECIFIC backing
      service names from the digest.
      ↓ lifecycle: executing
    per-tick planner reads brief + CHECKLIST → emits action
    ADDRESSING pending items (not free-form text). The gate then
    verifies item-by-item, not against done_when prose.

Why this closes the 2026-06-25 finance-sentry-mcp-readonly failure mode:
the agent shipped 16 stubs because the planner was passing prose to it
and the gate was judging prose. With a checklist, the planner dispatches
"wire `GetAccountsTool.Execute` to `IQueryHandler<GetAccountsQuery,
GetAccountsResult>`" + the gate verifies that exact wire — a stub
returning ``not_yet_available`` fails the per-item evidence check.

Same shape as ``planner.py`` / ``evaluator.py``: cognition is ``claude --print``,
JSON/YAML extraction + validation are pure, the caller is injected so
tests stub the LLM without subprocess.
